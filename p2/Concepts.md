# Concepts Part 2: Discovering a VXLAN

## VLAN
A virtual local area network (VLAN) is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). LAN is the abbreviation for local area network and in this context virtual refers to a physical object recreated and altered by additional logic.

## VXLAN
It is the same as VLAN but better for scalability since it can go up to 16 million hosts. BOOOOM!!!

## Switch
A network switch is networking hardware that connects devices on a computer network by using packet switching to receive and forward data to the destination device.

## Bridge
A network bridge is a computer networking device that creates a single, aggregate network from multiple communication networks or network segments. This function is called network bridging. Bridging is distinct from routing. Routing allows multiple networks to communicate independently and yet remain separate, whereas bridging connects two separate networks as if they were a single network.

## Broadcast
Broadcasting is a method of transferring a message to all recipients simultaneously.

## Multicast
Multicast delivers a message to a group of nodes that have expressed interest in receiving the message.
